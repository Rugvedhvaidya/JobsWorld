# Jobs World

This is a **Full Stack Development** Project is mainly focused on frontend. This is to demonstrate what we learnt in the course.

## Problem Statement
- These days there are many skilled people who are looking for jobs which showcase their skills but due to lack of awareness to find jobs they could not get desired job. And many employees lost their jobs due to pandemic.

- Recruiters also cannot find efficient employees to work in their company in a short period of time.
## Problem Solution
-   To solve this problem, we came up with an idea of creating a web application which helps both job seekers and recruiter.
    
-   Through this web application job seekers can narrow down their search, to the job of their choice.
    
-   And recruiters can find employees who meet their requirements.
## Project Setup
- **Step -1** :- Download the zip file provided in the classroom and unzip the file in the working directory
- **Step-2** :- Download Node from the site **[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** and install it.
- **Step-3** :- Open the unzipped folder in any IDE for running the application. Open a terminal window and head to the application directory in the terminal using cd command.
- **Step-4** :- Run **npm install** in the terminal, which install all the node modules required for the application.
- **Step-5** :- Run **json-server --watch db.json --port 3004** to connect the local database. If the json-server is not installed run **npm install -g json-server** and then run the above command for connecting the local database.
- **Step-6** :- Now we can start the server by the command **npm start**. You will be redirected to the web browser where the application is running in the **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** url.

- **The application will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
